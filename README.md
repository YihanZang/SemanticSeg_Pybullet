# 3DGNN for RGB-D segmentation
The model is trained by 3DGNN[3D Graph Neural Networks for RGBD Semantic Segmentation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Qi_3D_Graph_Neural_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf). The pretrained model was already included if you want to test.

### Data Preparation
rgb, depth, labels are required for training.
rgb, depth are required for testing.

### Emviroment
CUDA (12.0) + python3.9 + pytorch 2.4.1
